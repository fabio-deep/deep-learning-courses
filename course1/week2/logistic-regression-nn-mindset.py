Problem Statement: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
- a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
- a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.'''

Exercise: Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape (num_px  ∗∗  num_px  ∗∗  3, 1).

What you need to remember:
Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
-Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
-Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
-Standardize the data'''

'''Key steps: In this exercise, you will carry out the following steps:
- Initialize the parameters of the model
- Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost  
- Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set)
- Analyse the results and conclude'''

'''
he main steps for building a Neural Network are:
Define the model structure (such as number of input features)
Initialize the model's parameters
Loop:
Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
Update parameters (gradient descent)
You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call model().'''

Interpretation:
Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost).
A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
In deep learning, we usually recommend that you:
Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.)'''
